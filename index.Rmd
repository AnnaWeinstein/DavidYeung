# Warning {-}

If you know or suspect that you have experienced childhood abuse, please make sure you have a good network of support to turn to when exploring such a past. Please stop and ask for help if you feel any emotional turmoil arising when reading this book. While every effort has been made to omit materials that might trigger traumatic memory, the best protection is to have the support of a competent therapist to help process any such turmoil.
